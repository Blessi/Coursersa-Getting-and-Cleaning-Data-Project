# Coursersa-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
A project on getting and cleaning data
## Getting and Cleaning Data Project 
This project helps to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a raw data set to produce a tidy data set that can be used subsequently for further analysis. A full description of the data employed in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Making Modifications to this Script
Note that on line 2 of run_analysis.R,you will get the working directory having set  your own working directory to reflect the location of the source files to be downloaded and unzipped.You then download the files and modify the R file before you process the data.


## Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

One R script reffered to as run_analysis.R that does the following was created. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Additional Information
Additional information about the variables, data and transformations  can be found in the CodeBook.MD file.
